## Usage

After installing the project, open your web browser and navigate to (https://sharpn1.github.io/weather-API-dashboard//). Here, you can enter the name of a city in the search bar to view its current and future weather conditions. The city name along with its weather data will be stored in the search history.

## Features

- Current Weather Conditions: When a user enters a city name, the dashboard displays the current weather conditions for that city. This includes the city name, date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed.
- Future Weather Conditions: In addition to the current weather conditions, the dashboard also provides a 5-day forecast. This includes the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, and the temperature and humidity.
- Search History: Each city entered by the user is stored in the search history. Clicking on a city in the search history brings up its current and future weather conditions.
